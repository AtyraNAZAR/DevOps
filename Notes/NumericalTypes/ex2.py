#We are asked to create a program to calculate
#average score for a student with exam scores following
# 1 -> 70
# 2 -> 95
# 3 -> 50
# 4 -> 45
#calculate the average score for student and print average format, grade for student in average

student1 = 70
student2 = 95
student3 = 50
student4 = 45
aveScore = (student1 + student2 + student3 + student4) /4
print(aveScore)
