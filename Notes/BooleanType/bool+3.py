# We are given three sides of  a triangle.
# Triangle is equalateral when all sides are the same.
# So inn this code we have to display True when triangle is equilateral
# False otherwise

a = 9
b = 9
c = 10

is_equilateral = a == b == c
# The calculation above is possible
# bcs python supports
# chained comparison operator.
