# If Statement In Python

- Purpose of an If Statement is executing the certain parts of the code depending on the given
boolean conditions.
- When a ' Boolean' condtion is "True" for the if Statement 
**next* block of code will be executed.

### How do we know where next block of codes has same indentation. So that, by looking at theindentation
 we could understand beginning and end of the block of codes.
 ** NOTE!** a block of code refers to the lines of codes that belong to same implementations. This implementations
 could be "if statement", methods, class, etc.

 ### How if statement works?
 '''Py
 if boolean_cound:
    #code belomgs to If
    #code belongs to if
    #code that is not effected by if statement, this line will always
    gets executed regardless of the if statement's condition.
    '''
    ** NOte:** As seen on the example above, if a boolean condition is Trueif block will get executed.
    Otherwise will not executed.

    ##Examples:
    '''Py
    if True:
      #line1
      #line2
      #line3
      #Which of the lines above will be executed?
      # - Since the condition is True code block of if statement(line1, line2),
      #will get executed. Line3 will nebver be effected by if statement so it will 
      #always gets executed.
       - Since the condition is False code block of if statement(line1, line2),
      #will NOT get executed. Line3 will never be effected by if statement so it will 
      #always gets executed.
