A variables are in programming is like a container 
where we can store the data.

Why we use variables?
1. Storage
   Variables allow us to store data that we can use and modify later

2. Readability
      Debugging -> if you have an error or mistake , 
      you can easily find if its readable.
      Makes our code easier to understand debug and find what the data represents.

3. Reusability
    Once a value is stored in avariable, you can use that variable multiple times in 
    different parts of your code.

    Formula Of the Variable Creation
    variablename = value;

    Naming a variable: RULE: variBLE NAME cann't start with the number
                             it can not have spaces
                             can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore(_).
                             *alphanumaric: numbers and letters
                             Variable names are case sensitive which means
                             'age' is not same as 'Age'
    Nmaing conventions :  CONVENTION : how do you name the variable
                         There are 4 types of naming conventions:
                         1. camel case
                         Nmaing starts with lower case and capitalizes each word after that.
                         Ex: firstName, lastName, areaCode;
                         2. Pascal case 
                         Naming starts with an upper case and capitalize each word after that
                         EX: FirstName, LastName; AreaCode, etc.
                         3. Snake case
                         Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore (_)
                         EX: first_name; last_name; area_code

                         NOTE: Most of python users.

                         4. Kebab case
                          Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore (-)
                         EX: first-name; last-name; area-code

                         NOTE: When you creating a variable, type of variable auto understants by python.
                         Type Of Numerical Variables
                         1. Integer: Represents whole numbers.
                         Ex: age = 25
                         2. Flot: Represents: real numbers with decimal points. 10.2
                         Ex: weight = 190.5
                         ave = 8.0
                         3. Complex: Represents complex numbers that has both imaginary and real parts.
                         EX: -> 5 + 4j -> 5 is the real part 4j is the imaginary part.

Type Function:
 The type () function is the build  in Python function used to determine the date type a variable.
 Ex: a =10
 print(type(a)) # output is <class 'int'>
     b = 10.1
     print(type(b)) # output is < class'flot'>

     Importance:  Help DebuggingUsefull when learning because it helps you to understand how python works with data type

     Creating Multiple Variables In Single Line
     We can define Multiple Variables In Single Line
     By separating them with commas (,)
     Syntax: a, b, c =1.1, 1, "h"

     ADVANTAGE:
       Reduce the line of your code
       More readable
       Compact code

    Assigning Multiple Variables with a same value
    Ex: a = b = c = d =5   
    #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will
    #be assigned with a value 5

    ReAssignment in Python 
      After variable assigned with a value, we can also assign a new value to them
      EX: var1 = 6
         var1 = 10

         var1 =6
         var1 = "d"
         var1 = 1.1
         var1 = 10j
